### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Arden** but often go by **Aviox Arcade**
I'm the lead programmer of [LionArc](http://lionarcgames.com)

- I'm currently working on **[Ember the Warefox](http://lionarcgames.com)**, a small roguelite experience about a girl trying to survive in the woods.
- LionArc's bigger project, **Pawn's Path**, is a *souls-like* adventure game in a retro-flavored chess world, and has been in development since mid 2018

As I work on games and come across needs, I'm also working on some simple Libraries!
