### Hi there 👋
My name is **Aviox Arcade**, the lead programmer of [LionArc](https://lionarc.itch.io/) <br>*(someday we'll have a **✨real✨** website)*

90% of my programming work is proudly done in **GameMaker**

- I'm currently working on **Ember the Warefox**, a small roguelite experience about a girl trying to survive in the woods.
- LionArc's bigger project, **Pawn's Path**, is a *souls-like* adventure game in a retro-flavored Chess world, and has been in development since mid 2018

As I work on games and come across needs, I also develop some simple Libraries!
